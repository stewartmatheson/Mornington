== Welcome to Mornington

Mornington is an Actionscript3 framework that attempts to provide a number of
usefull Actionscript3 classes that allow developers to focus on the project at
hand rather than implementing code they should have. So far there is a full
state machine included as well as a number of movers and animators for display
objects.
